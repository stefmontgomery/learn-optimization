# learn-optimization

I created this repo to brush up on my optimization skills and learn new solver libraries.

In my graduate program (Masters of Science in Business Analytics from Carnegie Mellon's Tepper School of Business), I learned linear programming using the CPLEX solver. As CPLEX is very expensive for non-student use, my goal is to reimplement many course problems using a free solver library.
